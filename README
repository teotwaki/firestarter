In case you wish to compile from source, you will need the following:

Compiler:
	C++11 capable (./configure needs -std=gnu++11 or -std=c++11).
	We use clang for development.

Libraries:
	Boost (1.48 or above),
	ZMQ (3.2 or above),
	Log4CXX (0.10 or above),
	libconfig++ (1.3.2 or above),
	Google's Protobufs (2.3.0 or above),
	FastCGI++ (2.0 or above),
	Google's CTemplate (2.2 or above),
	SOCI (3.1.0 or above).

Tools:
	MAuReEn (0.1.0 or above).

Optional: 
	When compiling in debug mode (./configure --enable-debugging):
	libprofiler (part of ex-Google's perftools)

	For the persistence part. None of these are required, but at least
	one is highly recommended. Some applications may not function
	properly if you do not have the correct database backend available
	SQLite 3 (3.7 or above)
	PostgreSQL client library (3.1 or above)
	MySQL client library (5.5 or above)

Some of these are too recent for Debian Stable (squeeze), but can be
obtained from Debian Testing (wheezy):
	# Pull from Testing (wheezy)
	aptitude install -t testing clang libboost1.49-all-dev
	# Pull from Stable (squeeze)
	aptitude install liblog4cxx10-dev libprotobuf-dev libconfig++8-dev \
	libsqlite3-dev libpqxx3-dev libmysqlclient-dev

The list, however, is not complete: ctemplate does not have a -dev 
package available in wheezy at the time of writing (only runtime).
As for ZMQ, MAuReEn, SOCI and fastcgi++, they simply don't exist. No 
problem, we'll get them from source:

	# CTemplate
	wget http://ctemplate.googlecode.com/files/ctemplate-2.2.tar.gz
	tar xvf ctemplate-2.2.tar.gz
	cd ctemplate-2.2/
	# If you wish to install to /usr/lib instead of /usr/local/lib
	# use: ./configure --prefix=/usr
	./configure && make -j4
	# Install with root
	make install

	# ZMQ
	wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-3.2.0-rc1.tar.gz
	tar xvf zeromq-3.2.0-rc1.tar.gz
	cd zeromq-3.2.0/
	# There is a newline missing in the tar, add it so clang
	# doesn't complain.
	echo "" >> tests/test_monitor.cpp
	# If you wish to install to /usr/lib instead of /usr/local/lib
	# use: ./configure --prefix=/usr
	./configure && make -j4
	# Install with root
	make install
		
	# FastCGI++
	wget http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/fastcgipp/fastcgi++-2.0.tar.bz2
	tar xvf fastcgi++-2.0.tar.bz2
	cd fastcgi++-2.0/
	# If you wish to install to /usr/lib instead of /usr/local/lib
	# use: ./configure --prefix=/usr
	./configure && make -j4
	# Install with root
	make install

	# MAuReEn
	# The latest release of MAuReEn doesn't include some fixes we need. So we have
	# to pull from git:
	git clone git://gitorious.org/maureen/maureen.git
	cd maureen
	./configure.sh && cd _build && make
	# Install with root
	make install

	# SOCI
	wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/soci/soci/soci-3.1.0/soci-3.1.0.zip
	unzip soci-3.1.0.zip
	cd soci-3.1.0/
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" && make -j4
	# Install with root
	make install
