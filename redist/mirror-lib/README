IMPORTANT NOTE:
Mirror is being developed with the intention to be submitted for review
for inclusion to the Boost C++ libraries.

NOTE:
The Mirror library is currently in development and so is its documentation
(available online at http://kifri.fri.uniza.sk/~chochlik/mirror-lib/html/).

The aim of the Mirror library is to provide both compile-time and run-time
meta-data describing common C++ constructs like namespaces,
types, classes, class templates and their base classes and member variables,
constructors, member functions, etc. and to provide uniform and generic
interfaces for their introspection. Furthermore it provides several high-level
tools based on the reflected meta-data.
