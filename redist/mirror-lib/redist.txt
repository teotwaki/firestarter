The files in this directory (except for redist.txt) were imported from the
mirror-lib git repository. The documentation, unit tests, tools or examples
have not been imported for the sake of efficiency.

All the imported files should remain under the license they were published
as (see LICENSE_1_0.txt for more details).

This being said, even though the Boost license does not require this, if
any of the files in this redistribution are modified during the development
of the firestarter project, we kindly ask that you publish the changes
upstream.
