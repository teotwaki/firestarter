Mirror is a header-only library and therfore you do not have to link against
it when using it in applications. There are however many examples showing
the usage of Mirror and those can be built with either GNU Make or Boost.Build.
Support for other build systems may be added in the future.

 *** GNU Make ***

For the impatient: Just run make in the project root dir to build everything.
Influential environment variables are CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

On platforms where GNU Make is available it can be used to build Mirror's
and Lagoon's examples. Internally make is also used to build the documentation,
the development / testing sources make release packages and other things.

Several of the examples use external libraries like Boost, RapidXML, SOCI,
PostgreSQL's client C library, wxWidgets, etc. If you have them installed
in non-standard locations set the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
accordingly, i.e. add the -I options for additional directory paths to search
for header files and -L options with paths to directories containing additional
libraries to link to. If wxWidgets are installed on your system, the wx-config
tool should be in the executable search path. i.e. in one of the dirs listed
in PATH.

The external dependencies are optional, so if some of them are not available
an error message will be printed out during the compilation / linking
of an example source file, but it will not stop the building of other sources.

Since building of Lagoon's examples can be quite time-consuming you can use
`make mirror-examples' to build only Mirror's examples. To build just Lagoon's
examples run `make lagoon-examples'.

Official build targets for make are `all', `mirror-examples', `lagoon-examples',
`clean' and `docs'.

 *** Boost.Build ***

Boost.Build can be used to build the Mirror's and Lagoon's examples, by invoking
bjam in the root directory. The BOOST_BUILD_PATH environment variable must be
set accordingly.

Several of the examples use external libraries like Boost, RapidXML, SOCI,
PostgreSQL's client C library, wxWidgets, etc. If you have them installed
in non-standard locations set the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
accordingly, i.e. add the -I options for additional directory paths to search
for header files and -L options with paths to directories containing additional
libraries to link to. If wxWidgets are installed on your system, the wx-config
tool should be in the executable search path. i.e. in one of the dirs listed
in PATH.
